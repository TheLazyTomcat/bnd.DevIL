--- DevIL bindings ---

This is a direct translation of bindings to DevIL library (more info can be 
found here: http://openil.sf.net) into pscal.
It is written for dynamic linking and loading (DLL) and is compatible with both 
Delphi and FPC.

--- files ---

Only files in root directory are direct part of this project. Files in
subdirectories (mainly DLL files) were taken from DevIL project and are 
therefore not my work. They are provided only for completeness, since the 
binding depends on them.

--- licensing ---

All pascal files (*.pas, *.inc) in root directory are licensed under the terms 
of Mozilla Public License Version 2.0 - see file license.txt.
Other files (in subdirectories) are licensed under their own licenses, mostly 
GNU-LGPL v2.1 (see DevIL project for more info about licensing).
